# ENAE441_Final_Project
Orbit Determination from a Remote Telescope

Our group was given observation data of the 299°E Cluster of Echostar and Amazonas
satellites. This data set includes information about azimuth, elevation, right ascension, site
longitude, site latitude, and site altitude at a range of date times. Observations were made on
the 29th and 30th of October 2020 from OAP - Chile (-30.142°N, -70.695°E, 1500 m). We were
tasked with analyzing the subset “satBset4” which corresponds to 39008 – Echostar-16,
determining the orbit of best fit and conducting studies using this orbit, examining how different
observation sets and force models affect our prediction. The resources used in our orbit
determination analysis include MATLAB, SNaG-App, and the course textbook: Space Flight
Dynamics and Navigation by Liam Healy
